# Conversion Boards
Various boards to convert from one chip to another.  Unless stated otherwise, they are currently untested.

## [SMQD Converter](/SMQD_Converter)
Idea is to use a surface mount crystal in place of the through-hole crystal.  Why?  Spectrum clones from the former Eastern Bloc tended to use 14MHz crystals which are not easy to come by anymore in through-hole form, but surface mount versions are.

## [Dual Soviet Western 40pin Socket](/Dual_Soviet_Western_40pin_Socket)
Soviet-era electronics used a 2.5mm pin pitch rather than 2.54mm/0.1" pin pitch we are accustomed to in the West.  This can cause problems with larger chips as they need to be bent slightly to fit.  Hence this idea to allow a Western chip to fit into a Soviet motherboard, like an Intel 8080A to replace a Soviet КР580ВМ80А.

## [Soviet 40pin Socket](/Soviet_40pin_Socket)
The idea behind this design is to make a 2.5mm pin pitch IC socket for Soviet-era chips.
